# Access Swagger UI
Once your application is running, you can access the Swagger UI by navigating to the following URL in your web browser:
http://<your-server-host>:<your-server-port>/api/doc
Replace <your-server-host> with the hostname or IP address where your application is running (e.g., localhost).
Replace <your-server-port> with the port number your application is using (e.g., 8080).

For example, if your app is running on localhost and port 8080, you would go to:
http://localhost:8080/api/doc
